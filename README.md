LEARN COBOL

I have created this repo to document my learning progress as I dive into one of the most widely used programming language, COBOL.

I know just like I was at first, you too may probably be unware about it or if otherwise must be thinking how hard it must be learning and working with COBOL.
Well, this repo is going to living evidence that actually you too in this century can learn and master COBOL. It is not just a language that is popular among the old programmers most of which have retired but is now going to be known amount the younger generation of Software Engineers like me and you, who have been exposed to more modern programming langauges.

After having learned and worked with some of the modern programming languages like Javascript, Python, Java , I can almost say that I appreciate how COBOL is structured and I beleive that my expereience working with these modern languages going forward is going to be a different one. My approach to how I format my code(Identation) and Structure(Code organisation) can not remain the same.

Imagine how different you would indent your HTML code after experiencing COBOL.

To every one eles who is trying to learn the language, I have listed out materials that I found helpful in the resources section.
