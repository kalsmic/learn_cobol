# LEARN COBOL

I have created this repo to document my learning progress as I dive into one of the most widely used programming language, COBOL.

I know just like I was at first, you too may probably be unaware about it or if otherwise must be thinking how hard it must be learning and working with COBOL.
Well, this repo is going to living evidence that you too in this century can learn and master COBOL. It is not just a language that is popular among the old programmers most of which have retired but is now going to be known amount the younger generation of Software Engineers like me and you, who have been exposed to more modern programming languages.

After having learned and worked with some modern programming languages like JavaScript, Python, C++ and Java.  I can almost say that I appreciate how COBOL is structured and I believe that my experience working with these modern languages going forward is going to be a different one. My approach to how I format (Indentation) and Structure(Code organisation) my code can not remain the same.

Even small things like code indentation matter. Have you ever written or come across poorly indented HTML code?
Since COBOL is an English like a programming language, it should make sense to the reader visually as they peruse through.

To everyone else who is trying to learn the language, I have listed out materials that I found helpful in the resources section.
